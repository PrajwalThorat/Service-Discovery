## Problem Statement: Use service registry for service discovery

* In this exercise, you will concentrate on Service Discovery and its usage. It contains two Spring boot applications:
  - app-service – A Spring Boot based microservice which exposes one REST endpoint. This is a client-service application which registers itself at the registry.
  - service-registry – A Spring Boot based, which holds the information about all client-service applications. This service uses Eureka Server as Service Registry.


To solve the problem, you need to complete the following steps:

    1. Add the required dependency to enable Eureka Server in pom.xml.
    2. Add annotation in the Service Discovery service to enable the Eureka Server.
    3. Add annotation in App service to enable the Eureka Client.
    4. Configure properties in both Service Discovery Service and App service.
    5. Go to the browser to open the Eureka dashboard and check whether the App service instance is getting registered with Eureka Server.
